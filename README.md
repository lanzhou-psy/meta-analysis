The scripts were used in the meta-analysis about the association between childhood adversity and risk of psychosis. In each analysis, you should prepare the logOddsRatio and 95% CIs in advance.
Note: We applied mutilevel-analysis in our main analysis. Therefore, the ORs you saw in the Figure 2 actually are not the real/raw ORs extracted from the original articles, as they were "aggregated" in some ways using mutilevel analysis approach.  For people who want to do an update in the future, I suggested you can download the .xlsx file called "Main analysis_ORData_0205", in which you can find the OR data preprocessed by us.
